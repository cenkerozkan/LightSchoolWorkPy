Problem :

	Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart that will input 100 numbers and will find the number of 
	positive numbers.


Note :

	Normally we learn C programming language at school but since we haven't made it to the arrays yet
	I wrote it in Python programming language.


def (Function):

	array = [Random Numbers (both positive and negative included)]

	swapArray = [] (To isolate the negative numbers in 'array' into another array)

	iCounter = 0 (To check the negativity of each member in the 'array')

	while (iCounter not 100): (To break the loop, we have to set the range with counter variable)

		if (array[iCounter] < 0): (If the current number is negative)

			swapArray.append(current number) (To add the current number to the swap array if it is negative)

			iCounter = iCounter + 1 (To check the next element of the 'array')

		else: (If the current number is not negative)

			iCounter = iCounter + 1 (To check the next element of the 'array')

	print(array) (To see the whole array)

	print(swapArray) (To see only negative numbers)

	print(len(swapArray)) (To see how many negative numbers exists)


Function() (To run the function)
